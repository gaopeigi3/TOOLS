  - figure
```

---

## Presentation

```

---

# 9. Failure Modes

## Known Failure Modes

```yaml
failure_modes:

# Design Philosophy

A good pipeline should be:

- Modular
- Reproducible
- Replaceable
- Observable
- Extensible
- Representation-centric

---

# Key Insight

Most modern systems are no longer:

```text
Input → Script → Output
```

They are:

```text
World Model
↓
Representation
↓
Latent Operations
↓
Artifact Generation
```

# Meta Question Checklist

Before building any project, answer:

1. What is the real-world object?
2. What is the unified schema?
3. What is the latent representation?
4. What transformations happen in latent space?
5. What is the final artifact?
6. How is success evaluated?
7. What are the expected failure modes?
8. Which components should be replaceable?
9. What should remain invariant?
10. What is the system actually compressing?
